# FaMa Framework: Automated Analyses of Feature Models

## Main features of the framework
We present a Python-based AAFM framework that takes into consideration previous AAFM tool designs and enables multi-solver and multi-metamodel support for the integration of AAFM tooling on the Python ecosystem

Easy to extend by enabling the creation of new plugins following a semi-automatic generator approach.
